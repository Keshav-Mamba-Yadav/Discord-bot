Rule #3 – Do not undue influence on Koders. You are using a service and we are charging you for that. Simple.
Rule #4 - XHunter's word is law - So are the Kore's.
Rule #5 - Kore members are your friends. If in any trouble, take it up the chain of command (i.e. @YK  > @𝓢𝓱𝓪𝓻𝓴 > @Panther  > @XHunter) and we will be happy to provide any assistance.
Rule #6 - Do not invite anyone unnecessarily - they get auto deleted and you will be warned! Potentially muted.
